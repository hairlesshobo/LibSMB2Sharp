# LibSMB2Sharp

## About
This library is meant to provide native bindings for the 
[libsmb2 C library](https://github.com/sahlberg/libsmb2). The idea being that you 
would then be able to access SMB shares from any C# project, regardless of OS platform.

## OS Support Status
At the moment, only linux support has been worked on. After linux support is complete,
Windows will be the next target. While I would like to work on macOS support as well,
I am unable to do so because I do not have access to any macOS capable hardware.
If you would like to help add support for macOS, please let me know!


## TODO
* Add ability to open a file for appending
* Determine why DllImport cannot find entry point for smb2_fsync

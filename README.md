LibSMB2Sharp
===================================

This library is meant to provide native bindings for the libsmb2 C library. The idea being that 
you would then be able to access SMB shares from any C# project, regardless of OS platform.

I can guarantee that this is incomplete, buggy, and will most likely cause you to grow
obscene amounts of hair on your back if you even attempt to use this library.

You have been warned!
